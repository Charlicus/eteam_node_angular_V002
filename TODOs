TODOs

en cours
- make sure we have only one version of service when used by multiple modules...see favourite...bug when access a page directly, the current user is not avalaible when trying to access the profile..;

Next Steps
-> Try to include everything as a component of the user module by exports? exemple user services used in other modules ( exemple menu)
-> Complete module architecture ( user module,sharedmodule )
-> Create the membership logic

HIGH PRIORITY
-> Check the added value of isAuthorized in expressJS
-> Error Mngmt
--> Change the approach of changing server error when it's a user error? I'm not sure...
--> Potentially use next(error) and a good handler at the end to send the error back to the app with a clean message even when there is a server error)
-> Spinner, flash, on specific component...
-> Remove style for html

MEDIUM PRIORITY
-> Handle http request with string answers..., doesn't have to pass user info...
-> externalize answer and error handler on servcies
-> Understand why the ID doesn't come back in the save mongoose

LOW PRIORITY
-> clean timout in the flash when routing?


REMINDERS
-> Escape !
-> Don't return privacy values '-value' in mongoose
