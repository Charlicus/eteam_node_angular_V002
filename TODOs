TODOs



Next Steps
-> Save timesamp for comments, two objects in backend or manual save ( I see more manual save for now...)


HIGH PRIORITY
-> Check the value of isAuthorized in expressJS
-> Error Mngmt
--> Change the approach of changing server error when it's a user error? I'm not sure...
--> Potentially use next(error) and a good handler at the end to send the error back to the app with a clean message even when there is a server error)
-> Spinner, flash, on specific component...

MEDIUM PRIORITY
-> Handle http request with string answers..., doesn't have to pass user info...
-> externalize answer and error handler on servcies
-> Understand why the ID doesn't come back in the save mongoose

LOW PRIORITY
-> clean timout in the flash when routing?


REMINDERS
-> Escape !
