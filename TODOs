TODOs



Next Steps
-> Login
--> Check the value of isAuthorized in expressJS
--> Cookie Session is not working


HIGH PRIORITY
-> Error Mngmt
--> Change the approach of changing server error when it's a user error? I'm not sure...
--> Formatting of the error might be better on server side (Including Error Type?)
--> Potentially use next(error) and a good handler at the end to send the error back to the app with a clean message even when there is a server error)

MEDIUM PRIORITY
-> Only delete the right message in timeout...(flash)
-> Handle http request with string answers..., doesn't have to pass user info...

LOW PRIORITY
-> clean timout in the flash when routing?
