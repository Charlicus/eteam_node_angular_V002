TODOs



Next Steps
-> Login
--> Check autologin when session not expired...( On init on user service?)
--> Check the value of isAuthorized?
--> Redirect logic when not authenticated, check if something exist in angular2, try to maintain a status is user service?
--> Adapt menu to hide button and show link when logged in ( Logout button should be there too, next to a go to my profile link)
--> Have a Home component available for externals


HIGH PRIORITY
-> Error Mngmt
--> Formatting of the error might be better on server side (Including Error Type?)
--> Potentially use next(error) and a good handler at the end to send the error back to the app with a clean message even when there is a server error)

MEDIUM PRIORITY
-> Only delete the right message in timeout...(flash)
-> Handle http request with string answers..., doesn't have to pass user info...
-> public vs private for component functions...





LOW PRIORITY
-> clean timout in the flash when routing??? If possible but it's working now

Reminders
- CSFR security in all forms
