-> Membership logic -> _id not available in teamcallback... -> Weird doesn't work when Id is not initialized....

-> Create the membership logic

HIGH PRIORITY
-> Check the added value of isAuthorized in expressJS
-> Error Mngmt
--> Change the approach of changing server error when it's a user error? I'm not sure...
--> Potentially use next(error) and a good handler at the end to send the error back to the app with a clean message even when there is a server error)
-> Spinner, flash, on specific component...
-> Remove style for html

MEDIUM PRIORITY
-> Handle http request with string answers..., doesn't have to pass user info...
