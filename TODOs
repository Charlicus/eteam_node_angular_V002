TODOs



Next Steps
-> Login Form & Session status (Adapt menu to hide button and show link when logged in ( Logout button should be there too, next to a go to my profile link)


HIGH PRIORITY
-> Error Mngmt
--> Formatting of the error might be better on server side (Including Error Type?)
--> Potentially use next(error) and a good handler at the end to send the error back to the app with a clean message even when there is a server error)




LOW PRIORITY
-> clean timout in the flash when routing??? If possible but it's working now

Reminders
- CSFR security in all forms
